Before configuring short-term residential IPs, please ensure you have added whitelisted IPs or sub-users.

Note: Short-term residential IPs do not require selecting a session type, so this configuration step is not included in the following instructions.

 

## **Accessing Proxies via API**

1. Click on "Proxy" and select "Short-Term Residential IPs."

2. Choose "API (IP Whitelist)" and click on "Proxy Setup."

3. Select the desired country/region or opt for global mix. You may also specify a state or city, or leave it to random assignment.

4. Enter the number of Proxies to extract (up to 900).

5. Select "Protocol Type," "Format," and "Separator" as needed.

6. Click "Generate API URL," and it will be displayed in the "Get API URL" section on the right.

7. Click "Open URL" to view the list of available proxies.

 

### **Accessing Proxies via Username/Password**

1. Click on "Proxy" and select "Short-Term Residential IPs."

2. Choose "Username: Password" and click on "Proxy Setup."

3. Select the desired country/region or opt for global mix. You may also specify a state or city, or leave it to random assignment.

4. Select a host. For optimal connectivity, choose a server closest to your network IP address.

5. Select the IP addresses you need. Batch extraction is supported, and you will immediately obtain usable proxy IPs.

 

Reminder:

The extracted proxy IPs can be reused for free within 24 hours via the "24-Hour List" in the dashboard.

Please note that the validity duration of short-term residential IPs may vary. If an IP goes offline and later comes back online, you can still continue to use it for free through the "24-Hour List."
