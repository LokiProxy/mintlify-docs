To access proxies using username/password authentication, you need to have sub-users. The system automatically generates one default sub-user based on your login account, with a randomly generated password. If you wish to create new sub-users for proxy connections, click the **"Add Sub-user"** button. The following section explains the configuration and management methods.

## **Adding Sub-users**

1. Click on the proxy service you want to use from the dashboard sidebar.
2. Select **"Username/Password"** \> **"Sub-user Management"**.
3. Click **"Add Sub-user"**, enter the username and password, and optionally set data limits and notes below.
4. Set the status to **"Enabled"** and click **"Submit"** to complete the configuration.

If you need to start using the service immediately, please refer to the quick guide in the **"Configuring Residential Proxies"** section.

## **Managing Sub-users**

Click **"Sub-user Management"** to access the management page, where you can:

1. **Add/Edit Notes**: Click the edit icon next to any sub-user, enter notes, and submit.
2. **Delete**: Click the trash icon next to any sub-user and confirm the deletion./

If you need to start using the service immediately, please refer to the quick guide in the **"Configuring Residential Proxies"** section.
