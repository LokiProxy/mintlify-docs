You can access proxy services via API (IP whitelist) or username/password authentication. The API (IP whitelist) method supports both rotating residential proxies and unlimited residential proxies. To use API access, you'll need to add your IP to the allowlist first. The following section will explain the configuration and management methods.

## **Adding an IP to the Allowlist**

1. From the dashboard sidebar, select the proxy service you wish to use (e.g., Rotating Residential Proxies).
2. Click **"API (IP Whitelist)"** \> **"Manage IP Allowlist"**.
3. Click **"Add Allowlist"**, then enter the IP address of the network environment where you plan to use the proxy in the **"Whitelist IP"** field.
4. Set the status to **"Enabled"** and click **"Submit"** to complete the configuration.

If you need to start using the service immediately, please refer to the quick guide in the **"Configuring Residential Proxies"** section.
